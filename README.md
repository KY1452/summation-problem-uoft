# Pattern Is All You Need

This repository presents "Pattern Is All You Need," a thesis project focused on predicting individual atomic properties from aggregate molecular data using neural networks, addressing a weak supervision problem.

**Core Idea:** The research developed position-invariant, shared-weight neural architectures to learn atomic contributions from molecular sums, crucial when direct atomic supervision is unavailable. It highlights how architectural design impacts a model's ability to generalize and scale, emphasizing the importance of inductive bias.

**Getting Started:**
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Explore the model implementations in the `main/models` directory.
